REQUIRES - Times New Roman, Century Gothic
The shuffling of the answer positions have took from this website:      https://stackoverflow.com/questions/196017/unique-non-repeating-random-numbers-in-o1

This program allows the user to play a modified version of the famous trivia game, "Who Wants To Be A Millionaire". This program uses many logic
statments to check multiple user status, such as if the user has failed the question, has answered it, or has won the entire game.

The user will be able to go through these screens:

    SPLASHSCREEN          -  Allows the user to watch a simple animation to introduce the game.
    MAINMENU              -  Allows the user to choose between four screens, to play the game, to see instruction, to see highscores, and to exit the game.
    DISPLAY               -  Allows the user to see the question they must answer.   
    SHOWANSWER & GETNAME  -  Allows the user to see if their answer was correct or not. If the game is over, lets the user type in their name.
    INSTRUCTIONS          -  Shows the instructions on how the game plays and how it works.
    HIGHSCORE             -  Shows the user the 10 ten past highscores based on the file saved.
    GOODBYE               -  Shows the user some goodbye message and closes the console.

    TRY BLOCK USAGE
    
	The try block is used in this case to halt the program to give a sense of animation. This may cause multitude of errors, so

	in                              BufferedReader              Allows the program to read files.
					
	i                               int (loop)                  This loop counter allows for looping through each index of an array.
								    
	tempStr                         String                      This variable temporarly stores one file line as a string. 
								    It will also allow for error trapping against wrong data type inputs.
							    
								    
    This method contains the code to open the two files needed in the program. It first checks if the first two lines match what the
    program is specifically checking for. Then, it stores each needed information into two arrays. All of this is errortrapped so the
    program does not continue on without opening the needed files.
    
    LOOP USAGE
    
	Only one while loop is used to keep the program stuck if the questions file is corrupt or missing. Then, two nested for loops 
	are used to take each line and add it to the array that the program can use.
   
    IF STATEMENT USAGE
    
	Some if statements are used to check if the first two lines match exactly what is written in the code, while some other is used to
	turn "<>" as null.
   
    TRY BLOCK USAGE
    
	The try blocks is used in this case to catch any errors caused when using bufferedReader. BufferedReader throws an IOException,
	so it must have a try block to hold it. An FileNotFoundException is thrown if the file is not found and an Exception is thrown if 
	a line is missing or does not fit the front two lines.

								    error trapping against wrong data type inputs.

								    
    This method will be reached after splashScreen is finished it's animation. It will ask a user for one of four inputs,
    1 for the playing the game, 2 for the instruction, and 3 to highscore, and 4 to exit. Anything outside of that given range 
    will be caught as an error. The choice variable will store this input.
    
    LOOP USAGE
    
	One while loop is used in this method to errortrap against wrong inputs. Anything outside of 1, 2, 3, and 4 is not a 
	valid input, therefore if it IS outside, an if statement throws an error, re-asking the user for an input. 
	
    TRY BLOCK USAGE
    
	The try block is used in this case to catch the thrown error when the input does not match the given range (1, 2, or 3) or is not an integer.
	The catch block will then pop out an error window and reset the while loop.

	One if statement in this while loop checks if the value held by a variable is not part of the options given. If this statement is true,
	the statement throws an NumberFormatException.
	
    TRY BLOCK USAGE

	to tell the user to try again with a valid input.

	Variable Name                   Type                        Purpose

	i                               int (loop)                  This loop counter allows for going through each part of an array and animation.

	numChoice                       int                         This variable holds the numerical value that the user
								    entered. This is done by casting the char into a int and
								    subtracting 48.
								    
	ANIMATE_TEXT                    final String                This holds the animated text when you win, as it need to be
								    took a part at a time. This will not change, therefore this local variable is an
								    constant. 
			       
								    
    This method will be reached after the user answers the question given from display. This will check if the user got the correct answer and tell
    their status based on if they won or not.
    
    LOOP USAGE
    
	This program uses two for loops. The first one is used to fill an array if it is a certain value, and the other is used to animate the winning text with
	flashing colors.
    
    IF STATEMENT USAGE
    
       One if statement with another nested if statement is used in this program. The top checks if the user got the answer correct, and then the nested
       checks if the user has solved the last question.
	
    TRY BLOCK USAGE
    
	The try block is used in this case to halt the program to give a sense of animation. This may cause multitude of errors, so
	for the program to work properly, it needs to be caught. The first holds the message for a while to give suspension, while the second allows
	the final victory text to look animated.

	The try block is used in this case to errortrap the user input. The user is not able to enter anything than 1 and a 2. If they do, the catch block
	will tell the user to input another one from the choice given.

    LOOP USAGE
    
	The first two for loops in the first lifeline is an almost a repeat of the code in generateQuestion except the last question
	generated cannot be used. The other for loop stores it in the answerPos array, changing the positions of the questions generated.
	Then, the next for loop allows the third lifeline to show the correct answer position based on the number generated in it.
    
    IF STATEMENT USAGE
    
	One if block checks if the array is empty or not. If it is, it puts in a special character into the line. If not, it puts the value in.
    
    TRY BLOCK USAGE
    
	The try block is used to errortrap PrintWriter, as it throws an IOException when run. The catch block will hold any exception thrown
	to check for errors in other parts of the code, such as the file was not found, or the value could not be written. This will give

    LOOP USAGE
	
	Two for loops are used in this program. One, which has another inside it, is for the shuffle of the question array. This randomizes the locations

    This method allows the program to use the one of the three lifelines to be used in display. It uses lots of the randomization methods and
    checks the lineUsed array to see if the aray has been set to be used or has been used.

	Then, the next for loop allows the third lifeline to show the correct answer position based on the number generated in it.
    
    IF STATEMENT USAGE
    
	The main if statements check what button has been pressed, and if that button has not been used. This allows for the program to differenciate if the
	user is able to use a lifeline or is trying to use an used lifeline. The other if statements inside then check for other requirements, because some lifelines
	are not compatible with others when used in a certain order. One if block is used to check a random value, to see if the robo-friend gives you the
